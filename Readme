To solve this problem, we can use the following approach:
Use the requests library to send HTTP requests to theverge.com and get the HTML content of the webpage.
Use the BeautifulSoup library to parse the HTML content and extract the required information.
Store the extracted data in a CSV file and SQLite database.
Use AWS EC2 to run the script periodically and store the articles in the database.
